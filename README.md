# Hackathon Project: Observability in Robotics and IoT with OpenTelemetry

Weâ€™ll explore how to instrument code and visualize telemetry data and logs using OpenTelemetry and the Grafana open-source stack.

## Project Ideas

### ROS2 Telemetry
- Add OpenTelemetry metrics to a basic ROS2 service tutorial.
- Create a dashboard to show the telemetry in Grafana.

### Sensor Monitoring
- Read a sensor (temperature/humidity, ...) from your laptop and instrument it as a metric or log event with OpenTelemetry.
- Create a Grafana dashboard to view the data.

### Bring Your Own!
- Add metrics, traces, or logs to an existing C++ (or Python) project and create a dashboard.

## Requirements
- Bring a laptop capable of running a Linux-based Docker container and VSCode with the devcontainer extension.
- Pre-install Docker and ensure docker-compose is working.
- A docker-compose file that sets up Grafana, Loki, Mimir, Tempo, and the OpenTelemetry Collector will be provided so you can quickly instrument and visualize your data.

## What to Expect
- Hands-on experience with opentelemetry metrics, logs, and traces.
- Collaborative coding to learn how observability helps diagnose and optimize robotics/IoT systems.
- Quick demos where teams share their dashboards and share what you've developed.

## Quick Start
- Clone this repository

    `git clone https://github.com/dbarker/cmu-africa-hackathon.git`

    `cd cmu-africa-hackathon`

- Open VSCode  

    `code .`

- Open the DevContainer

    `Cntr+shift+P`

    `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

- Wait for the container to build (requires internet access)
- Open a termainal and build the example 

    `colcon build`

- Run the example 

    `source install/setup.bash`

    `ros2 run opentelemetry_ros2_example_cpp simple_process_cpp`

- View the logs, metrics, and traces in Grafana
